    "**What TensorFlow is?** \n",
    "* TensorFlow is library creating by Google Brain Team;\n",
    "* Is use mostly to create deep learning models, machine learning models, and artificial inteligence model;\n",
    "* Ensure tools to build and training neural networks, for both research and production research.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications of TensorFlow:**\n",
    "* TensorFlow is widely used in fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, data analysis, prediction and control;\n",
    "* It can be used for classification, object detection, segmentation, image generation, machine translation and many other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros of TensorFlow:**\n",
    "* It is very powerful, providing the ability to process large data sets;\n",
    "* It has comprehensive documentation and an active community, making it easy to learn and troubleshoot;\n",
    "* TensorFlow offers flexibility in building and training models, supporting different types of neural networks;\n",
    "* It has a rich ecosystem of tools and extensions, such as Keras, TensorFlow Hub and TensorFlow Serving.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons of TensorFlow:**\n",
    "* Compared to some other libraries, TensorFlow can sometimes be more complicated for novice users;\n",
    "* Because of the large number of functions and capabilities, it can be difficult to master fully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What TensorFlow provides:**\n",
    "* TensorFlow allows the creation and training of complex machine learning models;\n",
    "* It provides tools to optimize models, test and deploy them in production environments;\n",
    "* Provides the ability to accelerate the learning process by using GPU or TPU;\n",
    "* Enables experimentation and iterative refinement of models to achieve better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "***In summary*** TensorFlow is a powerful library for machine learning and deep learning that offers many possibilities for creating advanced models. It has a wide range of applications in many fields and provides tools to effectively research, build and implement intelligent solutions."
